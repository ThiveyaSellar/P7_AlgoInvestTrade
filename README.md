# P7_AlgoInvestTrade

## About the project

AlgoInvest&Trade uses algorithms to maximize profits for its customers.
The first step is to consider all possible combinations of actions to maximize profits. In a second phase, we seek to maximize profits without testing all possible combinations of actions, to save time.

## Built With

These are python scripts launched from the command line, which read csv files and display the best combination of actions.

## Getting Started

## Installation

- Clone this repository
- In the command line, run the following commands

### Run the brute force algorithm with the 20 actions file :

````python forcebrute.py csv/forcebrute_dataset.csv````  

### Run the optimized algorithm with the 20-share file :

````python optimized.py csv/forcebrute_dataset.csv  ````

### Run the optimized algorithm with Sienna's first file :

````python optimized.py csv/dataset1.csv````

### Run the optimized algorithm with Sienna's second file :

````python optimized.py csv/dataset2.csv````
